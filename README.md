### Some things you should know about me
* I am in my third year of study at the University of Auckland
* I have a learning disability (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)
  1. This means, among many other things, **I really struggle to start my work and focus on it**
  2. Music with no vocals helps me focus *a lot*
    * [This](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/24znC5fDTmPaKHYr3Ns0zg?si=698d664c47f949b9) is my favourite playlist to listen to while I study
  3. *If you have any questions about my disability, please email me! My email is [aroz297@aucklanduni.ac.nz](mailto:aroz297@aucklanduni.ac.nz)*

### That's all for how. Enjoy this gif of a cat. :-)
